Changes in source code
----------------------

libanyevent-perl has been patched to replace an hardcoded die with a warning.

The problem has been reported here:
 * http://bugs.debian.org/706453
 * http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2012/02/msg183037.html

AnyEvent.pm hardcodes a die() if IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent is in use but that
code can work for some uses. So the file
debian/patches/replace-abuse-die-with-warn.patch replace the "die" with a warning.
